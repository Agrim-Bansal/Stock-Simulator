to start off, I think auth will be it.
I want to do both of the things - making and using accounts saved in my own db. as well as oauth with google...

but i think i'll implement them later and just let variables work for the beginning.
IG I'll use shadcn for the ui, that seemed quite nice. So let it roll..
https://ui.shadcn.com
https://ui.shadcn.com/docs

I'm thinking coolors.co for a color pallete although i do like the black-white theme default for shadcn/ui

I found ready made login page on shadcn/ui so i'm just gonna put that and get done with it.

I'm kinda stuck at checking if logged in or not. I thought about using state for that and router.push to /login page but that is throwing an error and that might cause a problem.
solved it. I just needed to forgo the state and redirect from within the useEffect function.

Okay, so the password workflow seems really complicated to build and implement. therefore, I am going to put that off and instead, start off with the actual stock simulator platform

Yesterday I finished off with the sidebar save a little bit of fine tuning. Now I'm a bit confused with the structuring of data which is compatible with authentication. So, what i'm thinking is maybe i'll go and implement auth first.
Now for auth I am confused as to firebase or auth0 but since i'm going with firestore, so ig i'll just go ahead with firebase.

export default function handler(req, res) {
  res.status(200).json({ message: 'Hello from Next.js!' })
}
handling of https reequest - apis in nextjs

I kinda implemented the sign in and sign up with nextjs api ig. I'm not sure how that'll work. I'll see if i move it over to the login page itself.

Yaay. I'm done with authentication completely although a little stuff is left to implement on the account page 
- reset password, delete account, change email and also to setup a forgot password page.

Currently I think i will just make the research page with the following abilities and features :
- trending stocks carousel, a table with a list of popular stocks, a search option.

It is getting difficult to get a chart for the trending stocks carousel, and i need to design the search box part, the table is also wierd

Ig I'll work on the other pages first then.
Starting off with Account page - this has no relation to stocks and should be good enough to implement.
just diplay email, name and have an option to change password and delete account.
Also make a forgot password page accessible via link.

remember todo 
copy layout file from account page to all the other ones

ok. so i have set up the popular tickers although those are selected manually and fetched everytime. that is definitely going to run out of quota from the api. so Ig i'll store them in my own database for each day and fetch from there.
also i am actively looking for another api for the stocks. the one for logo is good though.
and i did make logging in good enough if not logged in on the account page. although account page itself for logged in users is left to be done.
